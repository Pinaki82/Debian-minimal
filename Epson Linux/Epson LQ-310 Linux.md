To connect an Epson inkjet printer to Linux, you'll need to install the appropriate driver and then configure it using CUPS (Common Unix Printing System). You can download the driver from the Epson website. After downloading, you may need to use `gdebi` or a similar tool to install the driver, or extract it and run the install script. Then, use CUPS (usually accessible via a web browser at `http://localhost:631`) to add your printer and select the correct driver. [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7]

[Administration](http://localhost:631/admin) -> Printers -> Add Printer.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. Download the Driver:
    • Go to the Epson website and navigate to the inkjet printer's support page. [3, 3, 4, 4]
    • Select your Linux distribution and architecture (e.g., `amd64`, `i386`). [5, 5]
    • Download the driver package (often a `.deb` file for Debian-based systems or a `.rpm` file for RPM-based systems). [5, 5, 6, 6]
    • You may also need to download the Epson Printer Utility. [6, 6]

2. Install the Driver:
    • For `.deb` packages: Use `gdebi` or `sudo dpkg -i package_name.deb`; to install. [5, 5, 6, 6]
    • For RPM packages: Use `rpm -i package_name.rpm`. [6, 6]
    • If it's a script: Extract the archive and run the `install.sh` script with `sudo`. [5, 5]

3. Configure with CUPS:
    • Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:631 to access the CUPS interface. [2, 2, 7, 7]
    • Click on the "Printers" tab and then "Add Printer". [1, 1, 8, 8]
    • Select your printer from the list (it should be listed after driver installation). [1, 7]
    • Choose the appropriate driver from the list of available drivers. [7, 9]
    • Configure the printer settings (paper size, etc.). [2, 2]
    • Click "Add Printer" to finalise the configuration. [1, 1, 8, 8]

4. Test the Printer:
    • Once the printer is added, try printing a test page to verify the connection and settings. [1]
    • If it doesn't work, double-check the driver installation and CUPS configuration. [1, 7]
