Comment=Run the PDF script

Exec=sh -c 'DIR="$(dirname "%k")"; "$DIR/pdf-single-page-legal-a4.sh"'

# Explanation:

# %k is replaced by the path to the .desktop file.
# DIR="$(dirname "%k")" gets the directory of the .desktop file.
# "$DIR/pdf-single-page-legal-a4-2.sh" runs the script in the same directory.
# Use the sh -c trick with %k for flexibility.

# This way, you can move both files anywhere, and the .desktop file will always find the script in the same folder!
