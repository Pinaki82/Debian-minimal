# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# I tested SMTube on a VM. SMTube behaved unexpectedly when installed inside the guest VM.
# It changed the cursor/'mouse pointer' to a
# black cross-mark. As a quick fix around the system without needing to install
# any extraneous package, I restarted the lightdm service and everything went
# back to normal again.
