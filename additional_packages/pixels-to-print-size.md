# Pixels to Print Size

Ref:

1. https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/456/is-there-a-general-formula-for-image-size-vs-print-size

2. [Omni Calculator logo](https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/pixels-to-print-size)

A general formula:

$$
\frac{Width[pixels]}{PrintRes[pixPerInch]} = printWidth[Inch]
$$

$$
\frac{Height[pixels]}{PrintRes[pixPerInch]} = printHeight[Inch]
$$

1 Inch = 25.4 millimetre

The size of a Stamp Size photo = 25 mm (width) x 35 mm (height)

That means, the dimension of a Stamp Size photo in pixels at 300 DPI should be:

Width = $\frac{25}{25.4} \times 300 = 295.275590511 \simeq 295.3$ pix [$\because$ 1 Inch = 25.4 Millimeter]

Height = $\frac{35}{25.4} \times 300 = 413.385826772 \simeq 413.4$ pix [$\because$ 1 Inch = 25.4 millimetre]

The same formula in reverse:

$$
printWidth[Inches] \times printResolution[pixPerInch] = width[pixels]
$$

$$
printHeight[Inches] \times printResolution[pixPerInch] = height[pixels]
$$

Thus,

Width = $\frac{25}{25.4} \times 300 = 295.275590511 \simeq 295.3$ pix [$\because$ 1 Inch = 25.4 millimetre]

Height = $\frac{35}{25.4} \times 300 = 413.385826772 \simeq 413.4$ pix [$\because$ 1 Inch = 25.4 millimetre]

The size of an Employee ID Card Photo = 35 mm (width) x 45 mm (height)

Which means,

Width = $\frac{35}{25.4} \times 300 = 413.385826772 \simeq 413.4$ pix [$\because$ 1 Inch = 25.4 millimetre]

Height = $\frac{45}{25.4} \times 300 = 531.496062992 \simeq 531.5$ pix [$\because$ 1 Inch = 25.4 millimetre]

Our Stamp Size photo at 72 DPI will essentially be $25 \times \frac{300}{72} = 25 \times 4.166666667 \simeq 25 \times 4.17 = 104.25$ millimetre (Width)

by

$35 \times \frac{300}{72} = 35 \times 4.166666667 \simeq 35 \times 4.17 = 145.95$ millimetre (Height)

Install ImageMagick and Montage (GraphicsMagick):

```bash
yes | sudo apt install imagemagick graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat
```

Examples:

`montage IMG_20211008_132718.jpg IMG_20211008_132718.jpg IMG_20211008_132718.jpg IMG_20211008_132718.jpg IMG_20211008_132718.jpg IMG_20211008_132718.jpg -geometry +2+3 out.jpg`

```bash

-tile 3x4 \
-geometry '+2+2' \
-resize 893x1663 \
4_6_out.jpg
```

### Image size and space between the images

`-tile` option helps you to instruct how the images should be arranged and placed on the montage.

`-tile 3x4` means 3x4 tiles in aggregate, 3 columns and 4 rows.

`-tile x1` means one row only.

`-resize 893x1663` means produce a 893x1663 pixel output montage.

The option `-geometry` helps you to set the thumbnail size and the space between each image. The default `-geometry` setting in Montage is `'120x120>+4+3'`. Geometry can be expressed either as `'120x120>+4+3'` or `'+4+3'`. The first instruction `'120x120>+4+3'` means it will produce 120Ã—120 pixel thumbnails with 4 pixels on the left/right of each image and 3 pixels below/above, where `>` denotes the resize option. The second instruction `'+4+3'` specifies the gap between images that are going to be placed on the output montage, without being specific about scaling the input. The first option is useful for shrinking the size of the input images that are of higher dimensions, although the option is completely unnecessary. It is only useful when the user does not want to set the dimension of the final output. Even then, using this option may affect the output files undesirably. If you have to get an output of a specific dimension, use the `-resize` option instead.

`'width x height > +4 px spacing on the left/right +3 px spacing below/above'`

Take note of the first command that specifies the dimension along with the gaps, since it can produce undesirable output. The `-resize` option will accurately determine the dimension of the final output montage. Thus, we will not specify the dimension in the `-geometry` option. We will restrict our use of the `-geometry` option to specify the gaps.

Now we will calculate the values to be submitted to Montage to generate a 4"x6" photo paper filled with Stamp Size Photo IDs.

We are limited to 72 DPI since Montage works with that resolution. That will not affect our workflow for now.

To calculate the values for the options, we will have to calculate the dimension of a 4"x6" photo at 300 DPI.

We know the formula:

$$
printWidth[Inches] \times printResolution[pixPerInch] = width[pixels]
$$

$$
printHeight[Inches] \times printResolution[pixPerInch] = height[pixels]
$$

That means, the pixel dimension of a 4"x6" photo at 300 DPI is:

4x300 = 1200 pix

6x300 = 1800 pix

No unit conversion was required since the lengths were measured in inches here.

We want +2 pix spacing on the left/right sides and +2 pix spacing between the rows (at the bottom of each row to use the gaps as white markings for the paper cutter machine).

The dimension of each Photo ID is 104.25x145.95 millimetres (at 72 DPI). But in our case, it is not needed. We won't even have to calculate the pixel dimension at 300 DPI resolution, which is 295.3x413.4 pixels. The dimension of the photo in its print size in inches at 300 DPI is all we need. You may ask me the reason behind going through the troubles of calculating all sorts of dimensions at various resolutions in the earlier steps. Yes, we need it somehow. Montage cannot crop/rotate/centre our photo. We will have to use an Image Editing Application to do that. Knowing the dimensions will give us an overview of the final arrangement.

1. Open GIMP.

2. Press **SHIFT + C** (Crop).

3. In the Crop Option, click the checkbox **"Fixed"**. Select **"Aspect Ratio"** from the drop-down menu.
   
   ![Screenshot20231020195626png](file:///home/appu/HOME/debian/Debian-minimal/additional_packages/assets/338a587e3772dcb681c059953b1083df6f81b92d.png?msec=1697820250479)

4. Set the ratio of the dimension of the Photo ID. In our case, 25x35 mm means 25:35.

5. Crop the photo and write it to disk with an appropriate name like DSC_85XYZ_25x35.JPG

6. Verify the dimension of the image by pressing **ALT + ENTER**. The dimension should be close to our calculated value without the fraction part.

7. From the Menu Bar, go to **Image -> Print Size...** The print dimension should be nearly equal to 25x35 mm.

We don't have to verify the cropped image every time after performing the crop operation. However, knowing the dimensions of the photos will be of immense help while automating the Photo ID Montage creation task through scripts.

Make sure you crop the image properly.

A 4"x6" photo paper can provide room for 12 Stamp Size photos at the most, 3 columns and 4 rows in order. How will you know that? Fill a 4"x6" photo with Stamp-Sized photos manually in GIMP. This will give you an idea of the final arrangement of the photos. Then you can write a script to automate the task of creating a Photo ID montage.

Calculate the total width that will be occupied by 3 photos placed side by side. $(25 \times 3)$ mm = $75$ mm.

And, the total height for 4 rows is $(35 \times 4)$ mm = $140$ mm.

In Inch, the dimension is: $\frac{75}{25.4} = 2.952755906 \simeq 2.95$ inch by $\frac{140}{25.4} = 5.511811024 \simeq 5.51$ inch, i.e., 2.95X5.51 inch.

Derive the dimension of the output in pixels at 300 DPI.

$$
printWidth[Inches] \times printResolution[pixPerInch] = width[pixels]
$$

$$
printHeight[Inches] \times printResolution[pixPerInch] = height[pixels]
$$

2.95x300 = 885 pix

5.51x300 = 1653 pix

However, some additional space will be occupied by the gaps.

$(3+1) \times 2 = 8$ (1 extra space for adjustments [the first +2 pixels gap])

$(4+1) \times 2 = 10$ (1 extra space for adjustments [the first +2 pixels gap])

So the calculated dimension of our output montage is:

$(885+8)$ x $(1653+10)$ $=$ 893x1663 pixels

```bash
montage \
IMG_20211008_132718.jpg \

-tile 3x4 \
-geometry '+2+2' \
-resize 893x1663 \
4_6_out.jpg
```

Write a script: `stamp-pp-on-4x6.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a montage of one photo on a 4x6-inch canvas
montage \
IMG_20211008_132718.jpg \
IMG_20211008_132718.jpg \

IMG_20211008_132718.jpg \
-tile 3x4 \
-geometry '+2+2' \
-resize 893x1663 \
4_6_out.jpg
```

Change the filename parameters. Your photo will be of a different name.

Run the script as:

```bash
chmod +x stamp-pp-on-4x6.sh
```

```bash
./stamp-pp-on-4x6.sh
```

A better version of the script will be:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a montage of one photo on a 4x6-inch canvas

image_file="$1"
output_file="$2"

montage \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
"${image_file}" \
-tile 3x4 \
-geometry '+2+2' \
-resize 893x1663 \
"${output_file}"
```

This script accepts the image file name as the first argument and a name of your preference for the output as the second argument. The first argument will then be repeated 12 times and be passed to the `montage` command.

Call the script with the following command (example):

```bash
bash stamp-pp-on-4x6.sh IMG_20231020_010203.jpg my_4x6_montage.jpg
```

Or simply,

```bash
./stamp-pp-on-4x6.sh IMG_20231020_010203.jpg my_4x6_montage.jpg
```

Press **TAB** to autocomplete names.

The dimension of our output montage is 893x1663 pixels. The size of a 4"x6" photo is 1200x1800 pixels. That means, we cannot directly print an 893x1663 pixels image onto a 4"x6" photo paper.

1. Open GIMP.

2. Create a new 4"x6" canvas.

3. Drag the 893x1663 pix image from your file manager onto the 4"x6" canvas.

4. Press **CTRL+M** to merge the layers.

5. Export the image to a JPEG file. Give the output file a name of your choice.

Now you are ready to print the Photo ID montage on a 210 GSM 4"x6" photo paper.
