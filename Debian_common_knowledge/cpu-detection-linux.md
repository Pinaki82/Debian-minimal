To detect the CPU model in Linux, several command-line utilities can be used.

1. Using `lscpu`:

The `lscpu` command is a primary utility for displaying CPU details. It gathers information from `sysfs` and `/proc/cpuinfo`. [1]

```
lscpu
```

The output will include a "Model name" line, which provides the CPU model.

2. Using `/proc/cpuinfo`:

The `/proc/cpuinfo` file contains detailed information about each CPU core.

```
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name"
```

This command filters the output to specifically show the "model name" line, making it easier to identify the CPU model.

3. Using `dmidecode`:

The `dmidecode` utility can provide detailed hardware information, including processor specifications.

```
sudo dmidecode -t processor
```

This command will output comprehensive details about the processor, including its model name.

4. Using `hwinfo`:

The `hwinfo` command offers a detailed overview of hardware components.

```
hwinfo --cpu
```

This command specifically targets CPU information, presenting a detailed analysis of the processor.
