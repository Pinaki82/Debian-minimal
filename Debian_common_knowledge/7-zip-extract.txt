Got it — you want to extract .7z files directly from the Linux command line.
Here’s a quick, clear guide for you.

1. Install p7zip (if not already installed)
Most Linux distros don’t have it by default.

# Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install p7zip-full
```

# Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install p7zip p7zip-plugins
```

# Arch
```bash
sudo pacman -S p7zip
```

2. Extract a .7z file to the current directory

```bash
7z x archive.7z
```

x = extract with full paths.


3. Extract to a specific directory

```bash
7z x archive.7z -o/path/to/destination
```

(No space after -o)

4. List contents without extracting

```bash
7z l archive.7z
```

💡 Tip: If you want to overwrite files without being prompted, add -y:

```bash
7z x archive.7z -y
```

If you’d like, I can also give you a one-liner that extracts all .7z files in a folder at once. Would you like me to prepare that?
