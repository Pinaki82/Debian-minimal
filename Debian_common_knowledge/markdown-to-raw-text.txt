# Markdown to Plain-Text (without formatting)

## Strip all Markdown formatting and keep only the raw text

MS-Edge Copilot:

Got it — you want to strip all Markdown formatting and keep only the raw text on Linux.

Here are three simple ways to do it:

---

Worked.

1. Using `pandoc`

```bash
pandoc file.md -t plain -o file.txt
```

Converts Markdown to plain text cleanly.
Preserves paragraph breaks but removes all formatting.

---

Didn't work.

2. Using `sed` & `grep` (quick & dirty)

```bash
sed 's/[*_`#>\[\]()!-]//g' file.md > file.txt
```

Removes common Markdown symbols.
Works for simple files, but may miss complex formatting.

---

Couldn't be installed.

```
pipx install md2txt
Fatal error from pip prevented installation. Full pip output in file:
    /home/USERNAME/.local/pipx/logs/cmd_2026-01-03_14.03.29_pip_errors.log

Some possibly relevant errors from pip install:
    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement md2txt (from versions: none)
    ERROR: No matching distribution found for md2txt

Error installing md2txt.
```

3. Using `md2txt` (Python tool)

```bash
pip install md2txt
md2txt file.md > file.txt
```

Handles headings, links, and code blocks well.
Good for automation in scripts.

If you want, I can also give you a one-liner that strips Markdown formatting directly from `stdin` so you can pipe it into other commands. Would you like me to prepare that?
