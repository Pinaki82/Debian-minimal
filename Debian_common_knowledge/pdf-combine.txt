Merge / convert multiple PDF files into one PDF
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2507766/ddg#11280219

Considering that `pdfunite` is part of poppler it has a higher chance to be installed,
usage is also simpler than `pdftk`:

⚠ IMPORTANT: Just make sure you remember to provide `out.pdf`, or else
it will overwrite the last input file in your command ⚠

```
pdfunite in-1.pdf in-2.pdf in-n.pdf out.pdf
```

A safer solution may include a test of non-existence
targeting the output file

```
export output_file=out.pdf && \
! test -e $output_file && \
pdfunite in-1.pdf in-2.pdf in-n.pdf $output_file
```
