The `Gtk-WARNING` message "Attempting to set the permissions of '/home/xxx/.local/share/recently-used.xbel', but failed" indicates that a GTK-based application, in this case, Zenity, is trying to modify the permissions of the `recently-used.xbel` file and is encountering an issue. This file stores a list of recently accessed files, and GTK applications often attempt to update it. [1]  
The failure to set permissions can be due to several reasons: 

• Incorrect Ownership or Permissions: The file or its parent directories (`.local` or `.local/share`) might have incorrect ownership or permissions that prevent the current user from modifying them. 
• File Inaccessibility: The file might be locked by another process, or the filesystem might be read-only or experiencing an issue. 
• File Immutability: The file might have been set as immutable using the `chattr +i` command, preventing any modifications, including permission changes. 
• Missing Directories: In some cases, the parent directories like `.local/share` might be missing, causing the application to fail when attempting to create or modify the file within them. 

To address this warning, consider the following: 
Verify Ownership and Permissions. 

```bash
ls -ld /home/xxx/.local/share/recently-used.xbel
ls -ld /home/xxx/.local/share
ls -ld /home/xxx/.local
```

Ensure the ownership is correct (e.g., `xxx:xxx`) and the permissions allow the user to write to the file and its parent directories. If necessary, use `chown` and `chmod` to correct them. 

```bash
sudo chown -R xxx:xxx /home/xxx/.local/share
chmod -R u+rwX /home/xxx/.local/share
```

Check for File Immutability. 

```bash
lsattr /home/xxx/.local/share/recently-used.xbel
```

If the output shows an `i` flag, remove it using: 

```bash
sudo chattr -i /home/xxx/.local/share/recently-used.xbel
```

• Ensure Directories Exist: If the directories are missing, create them: 

```bash
mkdir -p /home/xxx/.local/share
```

• Restart the Application: After making any changes, restart the application (Zenity in this case) to see if the warning persists.
