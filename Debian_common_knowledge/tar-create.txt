This will produce an LZMA compressed archive foo.tar.lrz from a directory named foo:
lrztar foo
This will produce an LZMA compressed archive bar.lrz from a file named bar:
lrzip bar
For extreme compression, add the -z switch which enables ZPAQ but takes notably longer than LZMA:
lrztar -z foo
For extremely fast compression and decompression, use the -l switch for LZO:
lrzip -l bar
By default, lrzip can use up to your available ram size to remember the file block history. If the file you compress is bigger than that, add the -U switch to enable on disk mapping. Note that it will be considerably slower but will handle file of any size:
lrzip -U bar
Decompression
To completely extract an archived directory:
lrzuntar foo.tar.lrz
To decompress bar.lrz to bar:
lrunzip bar.lrz
