Disable Auto-Defrag on SSDs:
____________________________
Windows 10 doesn't perform traditional defragmentation
when the OS finds an SSD drive.
Instead, it sends 'TRIM' hints for the entire volume.
A traditional defrag is not performed on SSDs in Windows 11/10/8.
However, if you want to take complete control over
your system in regards to defragmentation,
open up a Command-Prompt (CMD.EXE)
with Administrator Privilege (WINDOWS+R -> cmd -> CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER),
then type,


schtasks /Change /DISABLE /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Defrag\ScheduledDefrag"


Then hit ENTER.

Look here (https://superuser.com/questions/1210453/windows-10-disable-automatic-defragmentation)
for more details.

You'll have to manually TRIM your SSDs and
manually defrag your Mechanical Hard Drives.

Run trim-ssd.BAT
Find it in the folder shell/trim-ssd.BAT.txt
Rename the file before using it.
Another option to TRIM SSDs from the GUI:
Start Menu -> Settings -> Storage (on the left panel) -> Optimize Drives ->
-> Select the drive -> Optimize
