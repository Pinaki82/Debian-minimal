## Less Interactive, Instruction-Driven Package Installer Scripts

#### Directory:

`root of the repository folder`

#### Files:

`02_debian_minimal_packages.sh`

#### Usage:

Allow the file to execute (change permission parameters) (_common step_):

```
chmod +x 02_debian_minimal_packages.sh
```

2. Run:
   
   ```
   ./02_debian_minimal_packages.sh
   ```

**_Imp_:** Do not prepend `sudo`.

### NOTE:

The files in the root of this folder are collections of instructions that can be used to configure a freshly installed Debian Linux system. The process is mostly instruction-driven, less interactive and less dependent on the user inputs. Do not blindly run the scripts since you may not need all the packages. The script can be a good starting point to come to a perfect script of your own. I strongly encourage you to make that changes to tailor your needs, which will save time in the long run.
