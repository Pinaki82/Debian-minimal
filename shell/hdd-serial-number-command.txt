NOTE: CID from SD Cards cannot be obtained with improper hardware
such as internal memory card slots in low-end PCs
that are connected via the USB Data BUS and external
memory card readers designed to be connected
through USB ports.
The CID of the SD card will likely
be intercepted by the reader.
Internal Card Reader Slots that are connected
directly through the PCI bus (or IDE bus) (expected
to be found in high-end prebuilt PCs
from reputed manufacturers) should work.

> This will not work through a USB card reader because the command to retrieve the card information is intercepted and not understood by card readers. Not all computers with built-in card slots will work, some internal card readers are connected through a USB bus.
