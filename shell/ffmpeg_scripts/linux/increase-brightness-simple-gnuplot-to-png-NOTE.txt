I want to take an output of a gnuplot file out.plt as png. Please give me a one-liner command if possible.

Certainly! Here's a one-liner command to generate a PNG output from a gnuplot file:

```
gnuplot -e "set terminal png; set output 'output.png'" out.plt
```

This command does the following:

1. `gnuplot`: Calls the gnuplot program
2. `-e`: Allows you to execute gnuplot commands directly from the command line
3. `"set terminal png; set output 'output.png'"`: These are the gnuplot commands to set the output terminal to PNG and specify the output file name
4. `out.plt`: This is your input gnuplot script file

After running this command, you should have a file named `output.png` in your current directory containing the plot generated from your `out.plt` file.

If you want to specify a different output filename, just replace 'output.png' with your desired filename.

Super!

Great! I'm glad that worked for you. This one-liner is indeed a handy way to quickly generate PNG outputs from gnuplot scripts.

A few additional tips that might be useful:

1. If you need a different image format, you can replace 'png' with other formats like 'jpeg', 'gif', or 'svg'.

2. You can adjust the size of the output image by adding size parameters, like this:
   ```
   gnuplot -e "set terminal png size 800,600; set output 'output.png'" out.plt
   ```

3. If your plot requires any additional settings or you want to override any settings in the .plt file, you can add more commands within the quotes, separated by semicolons.

4. Remember that the output filename in the command should be in single quotes to avoid issues with special characters in filenames.

Feel free to ask if you need any more information about using gnuplot from the command line!
