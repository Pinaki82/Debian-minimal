Here's an updated command that moves the text horizontally: ffplay -f lavfi -i color=green@0.0:s=1280x720:rate=60,format=rgba -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:01:30 -vf "drawtext=fontfile=/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Impact.ttf:fontsize=60:fontcolor=green:x=(w-text_w)/2+20*t:y=(h-text_h)/2:line_spacing=80:textfile='scriptrunner.log'" The x=(w-text_w)/2+20*t part determines the horizontal position of the text. Adjusting the value 20*t controls the horizontal movement speed. You can increase or decrease this value to change the speed of horizontal movement. ffplay -f lavfi -i color=white@0.0:s=1024x576:rate=60,format=rgba -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:01:30 -vf "drawtext=fontfile=/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Sans.ttf:fontsize=30:fontcolor=white:x=(w-text_w)/2-20*t:y=(h-text_h)/1.14:line_spacing=80:textfile='names.txt'" In the context of the drawtext filter within FFmpeg:    x=(w-text_w)/2+20*t: This part sets the horizontal position (x) of the text. Let's break it down:        w: Represents the width of the video frame.        text_w: Indicates the width of the text being displayed.        (w-text_w)/2: This calculates the horizontal center of the video frame by subtracting the width of the text from the total width of the frame and then dividing by 2. It ensures that the text is horizontally centered initially.        20*t: This part introduces movement. t represents time in seconds. Multiplying t by 20 means that the text will move horizontally over time at a speed proportional to t. Adjusting this value will alter the speed of the horizontal movement.    y=(h-text_h)/2: Similarly, this sets the vertical position (y) of the text:        h: Stands for the height of the video frame.        text_h: Refers to the height of the text being displayed.        (h-text_h)/2: Calculates the vertical center of the video frame by subtracting the height of the text from the total height of the frame and then dividing by 2. It ensures that the text is vertically centered initially. In summary, these expressions for x and y position the text at the center of the video frame initially and then the 20*t part in the x position parameter causes horizontal movement proportional to time. Adjusting these expressions allows you to control the initial position and movement of the text within the video frame. ffplay -f lavfi -i color=white@0.0:s=1024x576:rate=60,format=rgba -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:01:30 -vf "drawtext=fontfile=/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Sans.ttf:fontsize=30:fontcolor=white:x=(w-text_w)/2-20*t:y=(h-text_h)/1.14:line_spacing=80:textfile='names.txt'" By changing x=(w-text_w)/2+20*t to x=(w-text_w)/2-20*t, the text will move from left to right as time progresses (t increases). Adjust the value 20 to control the speed and direction of the horizontal movement to suit your preference. In the previous command, x=(w-text_w)/2+20*t, the text moved from right to left as time (t) increased due to the positive coefficient (20*t). To change the direction to left to right, I modified the x parameter in the drawtext filter. Specifically, I changed the sign of the coefficient related to time from positive to negative. The updated x parameter became x=(w-text_w)/2-20*t. This adjustment resulted in the text moving from left to right as time increased (t). By altering the sign of the coefficient from positive to negative (20*t to -20*t), the text's horizontal movement direction changed from right to left to left to right. ffplay -f lavfi -i color=white@0.0:s=1024x576:rate=60,format=rgba -ss 00:00:00 -t 00:01:30 -vf "drawtext=fontfile=/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Sans.ttf:fontsize=30:fontcolor=white:x=-0.157*((w-text_w)/2)-20*t:y=(h-text_h)/1.14:line_spacing=80:textfile='names.txt'"
