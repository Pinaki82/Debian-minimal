Ecosia: import edl in kdenlive

https://www.reddit.com/r/kdenlive/comments/xsbjod/is_there_any_way_to_export_an_edl_to_open_in/

> You can try using OpenTimelineIO, ...

> When I tried it, I got a message saying that I needed to install pip3 but I didn’t see anything about pip3 on the website or in the help files, so I didn’t know what to install. 




> Usually you ned to do a:

> python -m pip install otio-kdenlive-adapter

> Depending os distros it is pip3. Using the Appimage it works out of the box. Also there has been some improvements but they still haven't landed yet. Kdenlive team has just started porting the adapter to be hosted at KDE for faster development. https://invent.kde.org/multimedia/kdenlive-opentimelineio
