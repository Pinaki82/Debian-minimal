# git clone https://github.com/vacaboja/tg.git
# cd tg
# ./autogen.sh
# ./configure
# make/make -j4
# chmod +x tg-timer
# ./tg-timer

# Transfer the complete 'tg' directory to the location where you store your portable programs, such as '/mnt/hdd2/PortablePrograms/'.
# In the Desktop Entry file, modify the application path.

# ---
# Alternatively, the .deb file from the official website
# can be extracted and the
# application can be started from the extracted binary file
# 'tg-timer_0.5.0-1_amd64/usr/bin/tg-timer'.
# However, the dependencies must be found in the system.
