First, make a backup of your existing '/etc/hosts' file.
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts2.backup

Then,
sudo apt install screen
cd I2PdBrowserPortable_1.3.3-linux/build/
chmod +x build
./build
cd ../
cd I2PdBrowserPortable_1.3.3-linux/i2pd/
chmod +x i2pd
./i2pd
cd ../
./start-i2pd-browser.desktop

If you change your '/etc/hosts', the I2PD browser may refuse to connect to the I2P network.
In that case, run ./i2pd again.
If needed, restore the old '/etc/hosts' from the backup:
sudo mv /etc/hosts2.backup /etc/hosts
service nscd restart
To re-download Firefox-I2PD, run ./build

Papercraft

Introduction:
Papercraft is a tool to unwrap paper 3D models,
so that you can cut and glue them together and get
a real world paper model.

The main purpose of this program is to do the unwrapping,
that is, it takes a 3D model as input and outputs
a printable document with the pieces to cut.
It is not a 3D modelling program.
For that I recommend using Blender.

PhotoFlow 0.2.8

PhotoFlow Build Status

The aim of the project is to provide a fully non-destructive
photo retouching program with a complete workflow
including RAW image development.

Here is the general feature (wish)list:

    Fully non-destructive, layer-based photo editing workflow with realtime preview of the final image
    Support for 8-bits and 16-bits integer as well as 32-bits and 64-bits floating point precision, selectable at runtime and on a per-image basis
    Allows to load and edit images of arbitrary size, thanks to the underlying rendering engine based on the VIPS library
    Fully color managed workflow: user-defined input, work and output profiles, soft-proofing, etc...
    Support for layer grouping and layer masks
    Support for common photo editing tools: levels, curves, brightness-contrast control, blurring, sharpening, cropping, resizing, colorspace conversions, etc..., all implemented in the form of image layers

You can follow the development of photoflow and learn
about its usage in
the dedicated blog: http://photoflowblog.blogspot.fr/
