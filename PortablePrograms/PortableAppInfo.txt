First, make a backup of your existing '/etc/hosts' file.
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts2.backup

Then,
sudo apt install screen
cd I2PdBrowserPortable_1.3.3-linux/build/
chmod +x build
./build
cd ../
cd I2PdBrowserPortable_1.3.3-linux/i2pd/
chmod +x i2pd
./i2pd
cd ../
./start-i2pd-browser.desktop

If you change your '/etc/hosts', the I2PD browser may refuse to connect to the I2P network.
In that case, run ./i2pd again.
If needed, restore the old '/etc/hosts' from the backup:
sudo mv /etc/hosts2.backup /etc/hosts
service nscd restart
To re-download Firefox-I2PD, run ./build
