Locate the 'hosts' file in your OS:

Windows:

%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

Linux:

/etc/
Type 'ls' to find 'hosts'

Download curl if it is not installed on the system.
Good news: Microsoft Windows 10 comes with curl.
https://curl.se/windows/
"Microsoft ships curl too...
curl is also shipped by Microsoft as part of Windows 10 and 11."

Examples of using curl-download:
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts" --output hosts.txt
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts" --output hosts0001.txt

I assume that you placed this folder in your home directory.
Windows: %USERPROFILE%
Linux: ~/

0. Create a blank text file, 'hosts' (straight into this folder).

1. Copy all contents from files containing
the ostracised hostnames into one file 'hosts' that you've created.
Here's the how-to guide...
a) copy from your personal blocklist DB (Personal.txt)
b) copy contents from the 'hosts' (/etc/hosts) that came with your Linux OS (if applicable)
c) copy from the Microsoft supplied blocklist (provided here for reference) (hosts-Win10-default.txt)
d) copy from the created ~/BlockHOSTS/db_from_github/totalhosts.txt

NOTE: If you are on Windows, do everything from the Windows Explorer manually.
The directory that contains the 'hosts' file is %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\
i.e., C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

2. Rename the 'hosts' file that came with your OS
to create a backup of it:

sudo mv /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.backup

3. Copy the new file into /etc/:

sudo cp hosts /etc/
For example:
sudo cp ~/BlockHOSTS/hosts /etc/

4. Flush the DNS cache:

Windows:

ipconfig /flushdns

Linux:
service nscd restart

5. Reboot your system if required (usually a redundant step in Linux)

Maintenance:
Repeat the steps to update the blocklist once a month, at least.
Are you on MS Windows? Windows update can wipe off your custom 'hosts' file.
Recreate the 'hosts' file when it happens.

Do you use an Antivirus program that deletes suspicious files without warning?
Avast AV was deleting the file 'hosts' on my machine.
Although it is a security risk to add a system path to your AV's exception,
you can try adding "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\*" to your AV's exception
list in case your AV keeps deleting the 'hosts' file unconditionally.
Also, adjust file read/write permissions in a way so that no application or a
piece of malware can delete/overwrite the 'hosts' file. That is, disable the
write permission completely.
You'll have to change the write permission parameter in 'Safe Mode'.
The attached screenshots might be of some help.
