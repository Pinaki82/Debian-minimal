Installing the Latest CMake from a Source Tarball
=====================================================

Step 1: Check the Existing Version

To verify the currently installed version of CMake, run the following command:


cmake --version


The output will display the version number, similar to:


cmake version 3.25.1

CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).


Step 2: Download the Latest CMake Source

Download the latest CMake source from the "Kitware CMake GitHub repository",
https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases.
Select the "Source code" option in `(tar.gz)` format, and download the
`CMake-{version number}.tar.gz` file.

Step 3: Extract the Source Tarball

Navigate to the `~/Downloads` directory (_for example_) and extract
the source tarball:


cd ~/Downloads/

tar -zxvf 'CMake-{version number}.tar.gz'


Step 4: Bootstrap and Build CMake

Enter the extracted source directory and bootstrap the build process:


cd CMake-{version number}/



./bootstrap


Use `gmake` to run the build process:


gmake


Step 5: Install CMake

If the build process completes successfully, install the built binary
using `sudo` privileges:


sudo gmake install


Step 6: Verify the Installation

To confirm the installation, check the CMake version number:


cmake --version


The output should display the newly installed version, similar to:


cmake version 3.31.3

CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).
